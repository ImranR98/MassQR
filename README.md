## Usage

- Press the scan button to scan QR codes and add them to the scans list. Duplicate entries are skipped automatically.

- After scanning all codes, go back to the main screen to view them.

- Use the Export button to share the list to other apps.

- You may want to use the Export feature to email the list to yourself. Be sure to do this BEFORE exiting the app, as the in-app list is not stored permanently.

- To process the file (extract TRA receipt data), use the [TRAExtract](https://github.com/ImranR98/TRAExtract) PC app.
